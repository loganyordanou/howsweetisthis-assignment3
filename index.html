                    <li>Coffee Crisp has been a favorite in Canada since its introduction in 1938, offering a delicious blend of coffee flavored filling and crispy wafer.</li>
                    <li>The iconic candy bar was originally part of a series that included fruit-flavored variants, but the coffee version became so popular that it outlasted the others.</li>
                    <li>Despite its coffee flavor, Coffee Crisp does not contain any actual coffee, making it a caffeine-free treat that can be enjoyed at any time of the day.</li>
                    <li>In 2004, after a "Bring Coffee Crisp to the U.S.A." campaign gained momentum, Coffee Crisp was finally introduced to the American market for a limited time.</li>
                    <li>Coffee Crisp makes a nice light snack, a tagline that has resonated with fans for decades, emphasizing the bar's light, airy texture that contrasts with the richness of its flavor.</li>
                    <li>Over the years, Coffee Crisp has seen various limited edition flavors, including French Vanilla, Mocha, and even a Maple flavor, showcasing the brand's willingness to experiment and cater to diverse tastes.</li>
